--> If we don't specify any key in kafka, then messages are distributed evenly using round-robin because we used internal partition assignment with no key.
--> Now, if we specify a key then default partitioner works and messages appear in different partitions.
--> we can also pass partition explicitly and all of the message will go to the specified partition.
--> It is also possible to implement a custom partitioner based on our use case.
